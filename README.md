Hello There. 👋

In this Repository , i will fully explain Sideloading the the newbies . And how can you use it like a pro.
---------------Introduction to Sideloading----------
1.What is Sideloading on iOS?
-Sideloading on iOS refers to the process of installing apps on an iPhone or iPad without using the official App Store. Since Apple tightly controls app distribution through the App Store, sideloading typically involves using alternative methods, such as:
	1.	Developer Mode & Xcode – Developers can install apps on their own devices using Xcode, Apple’s official development tool. This requires a free or paid Apple Developer account.
   1.1	Enterprise Certificates – Some businesses distribute internal apps using enterprise certificates, though this method has been abused to distribute unauthorized apps.
	1.2	TestFlight – Apple’s official beta testing platform allows developers to distribute pre-release versions of apps.
	1.3	AltStore & Sideloadly – Third-party tools like AltStore allow users to sideload apps using their Apple ID, but they require periodic re-signing.
	1.4	Jailbreaking – By bypassing Apple’s security restrictions, jailbroken devices can install apps from unofficial sources like Cydia or Zebra.

Apple generally discourages sideloading due to security risks, but upcoming changes (especially in the EU) might make sideloading more accessible . But in this Repository , you can break that rule without risking anything or even living in the EU.

2- Is Sideloading and jailbreaking are the same thing?
- The answer is No, sideloading and jailbreaking are not the same thing, though they are sometimes related.

Sideloading
	2.1 •	Refers to installing apps on an iOS device without using the App Store.
	2.2 •	Can be done using tools like Xcode, AltStore, or third-party app installers.
	2.3 •	Does not require modifying the iOS system.
	2.4 •	Apple still enforces security restrictions, such as app signing and expiration limits.

Jailbreaking
	2.5 •	Involves bypassing Apple’s security restrictions to gain full control over iOS.
	2.6 •	Allows installing unauthorized apps, modifying system files, and accessing features Apple normally restricts.
	2.7 •	Often used to install alternative app stores like Cydia.
	2.8 •	Can make devices vulnerable to security risks and may void warranties.

The Key Difference is Sideloading works within Apple’s security framework, while jailbreaking removes Apple’s restrictions entirely, giving users deeper system access.
